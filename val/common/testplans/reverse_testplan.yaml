# Implied coverage calculation (auto-computed)
implied_coverage:
  total_points: 5
  verilator_covered: 5
  scenario_covered: 5
  implied_percentage: 100.0

notes: |
  Reverse vector module performs bit-order reversal.
  Verilator shows 100% coverage - all functional paths tracked.

  All bit reversal operations verified including symmetry property.
  Implied coverage is 100% - complete verification.
