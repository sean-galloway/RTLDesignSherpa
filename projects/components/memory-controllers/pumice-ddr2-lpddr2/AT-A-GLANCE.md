# pumice — at a glance

A DDR2/LPDDR2 memory controller. One index page: every feature area, 1-3
bullets each, so you can find the right file without reading the tree.

Depth lives elsewhere and is linked per section — this page is a map, not a
second copy. Authority order: `/GLOBAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` > the handbook
(`vault/handbook/INDEX.md`) > the uarch specs in `rtl/*.md` > this page.

## The shape of it

`pumice_top` -> `pumice_core` -> **three layers**, host side to DRAM side:

    AXI4 host ──> pumice_axi4_ifc ──> pumice_mem_cmd_scheduler ──> pumice_dfi_layer ──> PHY
                  (intakes + CAMs)     (arbiter + timers + refresh)   (the ONE CDC)

* **One clock crossing in the whole controller**, inside `pumice_dfi_layer`.
  Everything host-side runs on `aclk`, everything PHY-side on `dfi_clk`.
* **FSM-free by design.** The split/aggregate path carries `agg`/`last` in
  the CAM rather than a state machine; the arbiter is a combinational picker
  with registered feedback.
* One burst length per instance, decoded from the mode register at init —
  the same RTL does DDR2 BL4 and DDR3/DDR4 BL8.

## Layer 1 — AXI4 front end (`rtl/macro/pumice_axi4_ifc.sv`)

Spec: `rtl/PUMICE_AXI4_IFC_UARCH.md`

* **`pumice_wr_intake` / `pumice_rd_intake`** — dumb 1:1 AXI intakes. Decode
  AW/AR into `{rank,bank,row,col}`, pass W beats through unchanged, and own
  the B and R channels back to the host.
* **`pumice_wr_data_cam` / `pumice_rd_cmd_cam`** — where a transaction lives
  between its address handshake and retirement. The write CAM holds data in
  an SRAM and gates B on `agg && last` (one response per *original* burst);
  the read CAM reorders returns into AR order and collapses `RLAST`.
* **`pumice_axi_burst_chopper` + `pumice_wr_splitter`** — split a host burst
  into fixed-BL sub-commands with no FSM. The splitter carries no B channel
  by design; aggregation is the CAM's job.
* **`addr_mapper`** — flat AXI address to `{rank,bank,row,col}` under ONE
  knob, `ADDR_MAP.bank_lsb`. Row/rank positions are invariant; only the bank
  field slides (ROW_MAJOR / INTERLEAVE / XOR-hash are settings, not schemes).

## Layer 2 — command scheduler (`rtl/macro/pumice_mem_cmd_scheduler.sv`)

Spec: `rtl/PUMICE_MEM_CMD_SCHEDULER_UARCH.md`

* **`pumice_cmd_arbiter`** — the pick core. Bank-parallel activate, open-page
  bank timers, and per-cycle selection of ACT / column / PRE / REF, emitting
  an abstract command stream to a FIFO.
* **`pumice_bank_timers` + `global_timers` + `bank_timer`** — JEDEC "safe"
  tracking per (rank,bank) and controller-wide (tFAW, tRRD, bus turnaround).
  No state machines; each is a countdown that answers "legal now?".
* **`refresh_ctrl`** — tREFI accounting with JEDEC +-8 postpone/pull-in
  credits, drain bursts, and a REFpb bank rotor mirroring the device's
  internal counter. `refi_reload_i` forces an immediate counter reload (DV).
* **`init_sequencer` + `mode_register` + `powerdown_ctrl`** — full JEDEC
  post-reset bring-up, per-rank MR shadow with live decode, and idle-detect
  power-down.
* **`pumice_cmd_history_checker`** — a scoreboard, not datapath: audits the
  issued command stream against JEDEC same-bank sequencing.

## Layer 3 — DFI layer (`rtl/macro/pumice_dfi_layer.sv`)

Spec: `rtl/PUMICE_DFI_LAYER_UARCH.md`

* **`pumice_dfi_cdc`** — the single controller<->PHY crossing. Async FIFOs
  for command, write data and read data; everything else is same-domain.
* **`pumice_dfi_cmd_path` + `dfi_cmd_formatter` + `dfi_signal_pack`** — turn
  an abstract `dram_op_e` into the multi-phase DFI v2.1 bus, including
  runtime `rd_phase`/`wr_phase` placement to match the PHY's contract.
* **`pumice_dfi_wr_serializer` + `pumice_dfi_rd_aligner`** — drive write data
  at `t_phy_wrlat`, and place each read's `rddata_en` window at its OWN
  fire + `t_rddata_en` (a stateless delay line, so tCCD-paced reads do not
  collapse — that collapse was a real silicon read failure).

---

## Runtime modes — three independent axes (PUMICE-006)

All CSR-selectable, all **encoding 0 = build default and bit-identical**, each
mutation-proven. Catalogued in `docs/design-requirements.md`.

* **Axis 1 — scheduling** (`pumice_cmd_arbiter`): `order_mode`
  (default / in_order / age_threshold), `row_sel` and `col_sel`
  (oldest / most_pending / fewest_pending), `access_pref`
  (column_first / row_first / precharge_first), write batching watermarks,
  `prio_sub`, `qos_en`.
* **Axis 2 — paging** (`pumice_page_policy` + `pumice_row_pred_table` +
  `pumice_rbl_table`): 8 modes — build default, static open/close,
  fixed_open, adapt_time (adaptive timeout), adapt_access (per-row 2-bit
  predictor), rbl_static / rbl_dyn (row-buffer-locality miss counters).
* **Axis 3 — refresh** (`refresh_ctrl`): postpone / pull-in credits, drain
  bursts, and REFpb per-bank refresh with the device-internal rotor mirror.

## Verification (`dv/`)

Practice: `vault/handbook/dv/` — especially [[structure-trackers]].

* **Tiers** — `dv/tests/fub` (21 files), `dv/tests/macro` (4),
  `dv/tests/top` (5), plus PHY-facing checks at the root of `dv/tests`.
  22 TB classes in `dv/tbclasses/`.
* **Everything is BFM-driven** (PUMICE-014). No test hand-pokes a standard
  interface or valid/ready handshake. `pumice_axi_bfm.py` owns every
  `s_axi_*`; `pumice_fub_bfm.py` wraps GAXI for fub-internal handshakes.
  Timing profiles come from `TBClasses.amba.amba_random_configs`.
* **Structure trackers** (`dv/tbclasses/trackers/`) — passive per-FUB
  monitors emitting one greppable markdown table each, so a paging/refresh/
  scheduling decision can be followed ACROSS structures after the fact.
  Off by default; `PUMICE_TRACKERS=1`.
* **Golden model** — `DFISlavePHY` from the RDS-DV CocoTBFramework plus a
  `MemoryModel`, so top tests check real data, not just handshakes.

## Performance measurement

* **Utilization = beats / cycles VALID was high** (not per wall-clock
  cycle) — cycles where the master offered nothing are the testbench's, not
  the DUT's. 100% means the DUT accepted every beat it was offered.
* **Clean-room ceiling** — `perf_write_ceiling` parks every maintenance
  source (refresh off, page policy OPEN, page-hit stream, writes only, AW+W
  back-to-back) so the only thing that can stall `wready` is the datapath.
  Result: 100.00%, zero backpressure cycles.
* **Refresh cost** — `perf_refresh_bubbles` reruns the identical stream with
  tREFI cranked up. It is the ceiling test's POSITIVE CONTROL as much as a
  measurement: with maintenance parked the DUT never stalls, so `bp == 0`
  passing proves nothing until you show the accounting can SEE a stall.
  Measured: every refresh costs exactly 5 cycles, no scatter.
* **Mode sweeps** — `perf_paging_sweep` (8 modes x 8-bank and 1-bank
  spreads) and `perf_paging_sched_cross` (8 paging x 10 scheduling = 80
  combinations). Outputs land as `*.out` tables beside the sim build.
  The 1-bank column is the discriminator: with 8-way rotation every paging
  mode reads 100%, so that column alone cannot fail.

---

## Registers, docs and collateral

* **`regs/`** — PeakRDL-generated CSRs (RTL + docs + `pumice_csr_regmap.py`
  in lockstep). Regenerate ONLY via `bin/peakrdl_generate.py`; DV accesses
  registers BY NAME, never by hardcoded offset.
* **`docs/`** — the HAS and MAS specs (v0.5, docx+pdf, generated by
  `generate_has_pdf.sh` / `generate_mas_pdf.sh`), `design-requirements.md`
  (the mode catalogue), and the signal-contracts workbook generator.
* **`rtl/*.md`** — per-layer uarch specs, the authority for how a layer
  works. `LPDDR2_CA_ENCODING.md` carries the JESD209-2 Table 60 CA truth
  table.

## Status

* Board-validated on the Nexys A7 (reads and writes clean); the correctness
  backlog is empty.
* Open work is tracked in `vault/Tasks/pumice/` — see its INDEX for the
  shortlist and the next free task ID.
