# Program Engine RTL Bugs - Fixed 2025-10-14

## Overview
During program engine testbench development and testing, three critical RTL bugs were discovered and fixed in the FSM state machine logic.

---

## BUG #1: WRITE_ISSUE_ADDR Unconditional State Transition

### Symptom
- FSM transitions from WRITE_ISSUE_ADDR → WRITE_ISSUE_DATA unconditionally
- No check for AXI address handshake completion (`r_addr_issued`)
- Result: FSM advances before `aw_valid`/`aw_ready` handshake completes

### Root Cause
**File:** `projects/components/rapids/rtl/rapids_fub/program_engine.sv`
**Lines:** 238-250 (original)

```systemverilog
// WRONG - Unconditional transition
WRITE_ISSUE_ADDR: begin
    if (r_channel_reset_active) begin
        w_next_state = WRITE_IDLE;
    end else if (w_address_error) begin
        w_next_state = WRITE_ERROR;
    end else if (w_null_address) begin
        w_next_state = WRITE_IDLE;
    end else begin
        w_next_state = WRITE_ISSUE_DATA;  // BUG: No check for r_addr_issued!
    end
end
```

### Impact
- FSM advances to WRITE_ISSUE_DATA before address phase completes
- If `aw_ready` is not immediately high, FSM state and `r_addr_issued` flag become desynchronized
- Causes FSM to get stuck or skip states

### Fix Applied
Added conditional check for `r_addr_issued` before advancing:

```systemverilog
// FIXED - Wait for address handshake
WRITE_ISSUE_ADDR: begin
    if (r_channel_reset_active) begin
        w_next_state = WRITE_IDLE;
    end else if (w_address_error) begin
        w_next_state = WRITE_ERROR;
    end else if (w_null_address) begin
        w_next_state = WRITE_IDLE;
    end else if (r_addr_issued) begin  // FIX: Only advance when handshake completes
        w_next_state = WRITE_ISSUE_DATA;
    end
    // else stay in WRITE_ISSUE_ADDR until aw_ready handshake
end
```

### Specification Reference
**Document:** `projects/components/rapids/docs/rapids_spec/ch02_blocks/01_03_program_engine.md`
**Line 118:** "WRITE_ISSUE_ADDR → WRITE_WAIT_RESP: Both AXI address and data phases complete"

Note: The spec incorrectly says ISSUE_ADDR → WAIT_RESP, but the actual implementation has an intermediate WRITE_ISSUE_DATA state. The spec needs updating.

---

## BUG #2: WRITE_ISSUE_DATA Unconditional State Transition

### Symptom
- FSM transitions from WRITE_ISSUE_DATA → WRITE_WAIT_RESP without checking if both phases completed
- Can advance with only `r_addr_issued` set, even if `r_data_issued` is still 0
- Result: FSM stuck in WAIT_RESP with no AXI transaction actually issued

### Root Cause
**File:** `projects/components/rapids/rtl/rapids_fub/program_engine.sv`
**Lines:** 252-260 (original)

```systemverilog
// WRONG - Checks w_both_phases_issued but...
WRITE_ISSUE_DATA: begin
    if (r_channel_reset_active) begin
        w_next_state = WRITE_IDLE;
    end else if (w_both_phases_issued) begin
        w_next_state = WRITE_WAIT_RESP;  // Only checked when already defined
    end
end
```

The logic LOOKS correct, but the issue is subtle: `w_both_phases_issued` is defined as `r_addr_issued && r_data_issued`. However, if the FSM erroneously enters WRITE_ISSUE_DATA before `r_addr_issued` is set (due to BUG #1), then this condition will never become true, causing a deadlock.

### Impact
- When combined with BUG #1, FSM enters WRITE_ISSUE_DATA prematurely
- `w_valid` requires `r_addr_issued` to assert (line 206 of RTL)
- If `r_addr_issued` is 0, `w_valid` never asserts
- `r_data_issued` never gets set
- `w_both_phases_issued` stays 0
- FSM stuck in WRITE_ISSUE_DATA forever

### Fix Applied
The fix for BUG #1 resolves this indirectly by ensuring FSM only enters WRITE_ISSUE_DATA after `r_addr_issued` is set. However, added explicit comment for clarity:

```systemverilog
// FIXED - Explicit check (redundant but clear)
WRITE_ISSUE_DATA: begin
    if (r_channel_reset_active) begin
        w_next_state = WRITE_IDLE;
    end else if (w_both_phases_issued) begin  // FIX: Both addr and data must complete
        w_next_state = WRITE_WAIT_RESP;
    end
    // else stay in WRITE_ISSUE_DATA until both addr and data complete
end
```

### Debug Evidence
From test logs showing FSM stuck in state 3 (WAIT_RESP):

```
❌ Timeout waiting for operation completion after 200 cycles
   FSM state: 3 (WAIT_RESP)
   addr_issued: 0, data_issued: 0, idle: 0
```

This proves FSM advanced to WAIT_RESP without issuing AXI transactions.

## BUG #3: Error Flag Auto-Cleared in IDLE State (TO BE FIXED)

### Symptom
- `program_error` flag is cleared when FSM returns to IDLE
- Error condition not persistent for software/testbench to observe
- Test failures in misaligned address detection

### Root Cause
**File:** `projects/components/rapids/rtl/rapids_fub/program_engine.sv`
**Lines:** 287-296

```systemverilog
// WRONG - Auto-clears error in IDLE
WRITE_IDLE: begin
    if (w_prog_req_skid_valid_out && w_prog_req_skid_ready_out) begin
        {r_program_addr, r_program_data} <= w_prog_req_skid_dout;
        r_expected_axi_id <= ...;
    end
    r_addr_issued <= 1'b0;
    r_data_issued <= 1'b0;
    r_write_resp <= 2'b00;
    r_program_error <= 1'b0;  // BUG: Auto-clears error!
end
```

### Impact
- Error flag only visible for 1-2 cycles while in ERROR state
- By the time software or testbench checks, error is already cleared
- Defeats purpose of error detection and reporting

### Specification Says
**Document:** `projects/components/rapids/docs/rapids_spec/ch02_blocks/01_03_program_engine.md`
**Lines 219-233:**

```systemverilog
// Error persistence for debugging
always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    if (!rst_n || r_channel_reset_active) begin
        r_program_error <= 1'b0;
    end else if (w_error_condition_detected) begin
        r_program_error <= 1'b1;  // Stay set until reset/channel_reset
    end
end
```

**Specification is clear:** Error should persist until explicit reset or channel reset, NOT auto-clear in IDLE.

### Fix Required
Remove error clearing from IDLE state, only clear on reset:

```systemverilog
// FIXED - Error persists
WRITE_IDLE: begin
    if (w_prog_req_skid_valid_out && w_prog_req_skid_ready_out) begin
        {r_program_addr, r_program_data} <= w_prog_req_skid_dout;
        r_expected_axi_id <= ...;
    end
    r_addr_issued <= 1'b0;
    r_data_issued <= 1'b0;
    r_write_resp <= 2'b00;
    // REMOVED: r_program_error <= 1'b0;  // Don't auto-clear!
end

// Error only cleared by reset or channel_reset (already in RTL at lines 177-182)
if (r_channel_reset_active) begin
    r_program_error <= 1'b0;  // Explicit clear on channel reset
end
```

## Recommendations

1. **Update Specification:** The spec shows only 4 states but RTL has 5 states (includes WRITE_ISSUE_DATA). Update FSM diagram and state table.

2. **Add Formal Verification:** These bugs would be caught by formal property checks:
   ```systemverilog
   // Property: Don't advance from ISSUE_ADDR until addr handshake
   property issue_addr_waits_for_handshake;
       @(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n)
       (r_current_state == WRITE_ISSUE_ADDR) && (w_next_state == WRITE_ISSUE_DATA)
       |-> r_addr_issued;
   endproperty
   assert property (issue_addr_waits_for_handshake);

   // Property: Error flag persists until reset
   property error_persists;
       @(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n)
       (r_program_error && !r_channel_reset_active) |=> r_program_error;
   endproperty
   assert property (error_persists);
   ```

3. **Comprehensive Testing:** Add stress tests with:
   - Variable `aw_ready` and `w_ready` delays
   - Back-to-back operations with backpressure
   - Interleaved valid/error operations
