# Sink Data Path - Known RTL Issues

## AXI Timeout Detection Missing

**Severity**: Medium
**Impact**: Timeout errors not detected or reported
**Status**: Missing functionality - placeholder implementation
**Discovery Date**: During RTL review

### Description

AXI timeout detection is not implemented in the sink data path, with only a placeholder assignment that always returns false.

### Location

**File**: `projects/components/rapids/rtl/rapids_macro/sink_data_path.sv`
**Line**: 283

### Current Code (Incomplete)
```systemverilog
assign error_axi_timeout = 1'b0;  // TODO: Add timeout detection from AXI engine
```

### Impact on Functionality

1. **Error Detection**: AXI transaction timeouts are not detected
2. **System Monitoring**: No visibility into stuck AXI transactions
3. **Error Recovery**: Timeout-based recovery mechanisms cannot operate
4. **Debug Capability**: Cannot identify slow or hanging AXI transactions

### Root Cause

Timeout detection logic was not implemented in the initial version, leaving only a placeholder that disables timeout reporting.

### Required Implementation

The timeout detection should:
1. Monitor AXI transaction duration
2. Compare against configurable timeout threshold
3. Assert error when threshold exceeded
4. Provide timeout event reporting via monitor bus

### Fix Priority

**Medium Priority** - Required for robust error handling and system monitoring in production environments with potential AXI slave latency issues.

### Additional Notes

- Error signal is properly connected to higher-level error reporting
- Infrastructure exists for timeout error handling
- Only the detection logic itself is missing
