# Sink SRAM Control - Known RTL Issues

## Single Read Operation Limitation

**Severity**: Low
**Impact**: Concurrent read operations not supported
**Status**: Simplified implementation - architectural limitation
**Discovery Date**: During RTL review

### Description

The SRAM control module is implemented with a simplified architecture that only supports one read operation at a time, which may limit throughput in high-performance scenarios.

### Location

**File**: `projects/components/rapids/rtl/rapids_fub/sink_sram_control.sv`
**Line**: 685

### Current Code (Limitation)
```systemverilog
// TODO: This is a simplified implementation that only supports one read at a time
```

### Impact on Functionality

1. **Throughput**: Multiple concurrent reads cannot be processed
2. **Performance**: Potential bottleneck in read-heavy workloads
3. **Utilization**: SRAM bandwidth may be underutilized
4. **Latency**: Read operations must be serialized

### Root Cause

The current implementation was designed for simplicity rather than maximum performance, implementing a single-read-at-a-time architecture.

### Potential Enhancement

A full implementation could support:
1. Multiple concurrent read operations
2. Read operation pipelining
3. Improved memory bandwidth utilization
4. Reduced read latency through parallelism

### Fix Priority

**Low Priority** - This is an architectural simplification rather than a bug. Enhancement would be beneficial for high-performance applications but current implementation is functionally correct.

### Additional Notes

- Current implementation is stable and functionally correct
- All other SRAM control features work as designed
- Enhancement would require significant architectural changes
- Performance impact depends on specific workload characteristics
