notes: 'Allocation Control manages virtual FIFO space tracking for buffer management.

  FUB Beats generation with 100% test coverage (5/5 scenarios passing).


  Key features:

  - Variable-size allocation requests (multi-beat allocations)

  - Single-beat drain acknowledgments

  - Full/empty flag generation

  - Almost-full/almost-empty early warning

  - Registered outputs for timing closure


  All functional scenarios verified. Beats generation at 100% coverage.
