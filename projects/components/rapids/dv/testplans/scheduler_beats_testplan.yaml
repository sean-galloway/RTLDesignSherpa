notes: 'Scheduler coordinates RAPIDS Phase 1 operations (network-to-memory).

  FUB Beats generation with 100% test coverage (11/11 scenarios passing).


  Key features:

  - Concurrent read/write (prevents deadlock for large transfers)

  - Beat-based length tracking (aligned addresses only)

  - Descriptor chaining via next_descriptor_ptr

  - IRQ event generation via MonBus

  - Error handling (descriptor, read engine, write engine)

  - Channel reset support


  RAPIDS Phase 1 simplifications:

  - No credit management (Phase 2 feature)

  - No control engines (Phase 2 feature)

  - No alignment fixup (addresses must be aligned)


  All functional scenarios verified. Beats generation at 100% coverage.
