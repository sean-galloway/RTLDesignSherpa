# Bridge Connectivity Matrix for Channel-Specific Configuration
# Defines which masters can access which slaves
#
# Format:
#   - First row: slave port names (must match port_name in ports.csv)
#   - First column: master port names (must match port_name in ports.csv)
#   - Values: 1 = connected, 0 = not connected
#
# Notes:
#   - rapids_descr_wr: Write-only master for descriptor writes
#   - rapids_sink_wr: Write-only master for incoming data writes
#   - rapids_src_rd: Read-only master for outgoing data reads
#   - stream_master: Full read/write master
#   - cpu_master: Full read/write master for configuration
