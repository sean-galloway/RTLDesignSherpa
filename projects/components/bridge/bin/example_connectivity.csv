# Bridge Connectivity Matrix
# Defines which masters can access which slaves
#
# Format:
#   - First row: slave port names (must match port_name in ports.csv)
#   - First column: master port names (must match port_name in ports.csv)
#   - Values: 1 = connected, 0 = not connected
#
# Notes:
#   - Not all masters need to connect to all slaves
#   - Reduces crossbar complexity and resource usage
#   - Each master must connect to at least one slave
#   - Each slave should be reachable from at least one master
