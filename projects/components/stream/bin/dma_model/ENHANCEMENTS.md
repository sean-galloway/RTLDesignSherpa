## 1. PERFECT Performance Mode

### What It Does

PERFECT mode is a **theoretical performance mode** that shows what would be required to saturate the AXI bus with a **single channel**.

### Configuration

```python
PERFECT_PERF_CONFIG = {
    'name': 'Perfect (Theoretical)',
    'max_burst_len_read': 256,
    'max_burst_len_write': 256,
    'max_outstanding_read': 256,      # Effectively unlimited
    'max_outstanding_write': 256,     # Effectively unlimited
    'pipeline_depth': 256,             # Deep pipeline
    'sram_lines_per_channel': 4096,   # 256 KB per channel (32x increase!)
    'use_case': 'Theoretical maximum'
}
```

### Key Results (1KB Payload)

| Metric | HIGH Mode | PERFECT Mode | Ratio |
|--------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **SRAM per channel** | 128 lines (8 KB) | 4096 lines (256 KB) | **32x** |
| **Single channel BW** | 24.98 GB/s (43%) | 61.02 GB/s (100%+) | **2.4x** |
| **8 channel BW** | 57.6 GB/s (saturated) | 57.6 GB/s (saturated) | **Same** |
| **Bottleneck (1ch)** | SRAM capacity | AXI peak | - |

### Why It Matters

**Design Insight:** PERFECT mode demonstrates that:
1. **Single-channel saturation is possible** but requires **32x more SRAM** (256 KB vs 8 KB per channel)
2. **No performance gain** when using multiple channels (both saturate at 57.6 GB/s)
3. **Channel parallelism is more efficient** than deep per-channel buffers

**Conclusion:** STREAM's design choice to use **channel aggregation** (8 × 8 KB) instead of deep single-channel buffers (1 × 256 KB) is **area-efficient and flexible**.

### Usage

```bash
# Analyze PERFECT mode only
python3 comprehensive_analysis.py --mode PERFECT

# Include PERFECT in full analysis
python3 comprehensive_analysis.py --include-perfect

# Generate PERFECT mode report
python3 comprehensive_analysis.py --mode PERFECT --report
```

### Example Output

```markdown
## Design Limitations

- **Read pipeline limited to 8** (desired: 16) by SRAM capacity
- **Write pipeline limited to 8** (desired: 16) by SRAM capacity
- **SRAM capacity (128 lines)** insufficient for deep pipelining at current payload size
- **Low single-channel efficiency (43.4%)** - requires multiple channels to achieve good throughput

## Optimization Recommendations

- **Increase SRAM per channel** to enable deeper pipelining for single-channel performance
- **Or use multiple channels** to aggregate bandwidth (current strategy)
- **Already saturating AXI bus** with 8 channels
- **Increase payload size** to take advantage of larger burst capability (256 beats)
```

# Generate report for specific mode
python3 comprehensive_analysis.py --mode HIGH --report

# Generate reports for all modes
python3 comprehensive_analysis.py --report

# Include PERFECT mode in reports

## 3. Detailed Design Limitation Analysis

### What's Explained

Each mode now has clear documentation of:

1. **Why single channel can't saturate** (for HIGH/PERFECT modes)
2. **What limits performance** (timing, SRAM, AXI peak, max outstanding)
3. **How to improve** (mode-specific recommendations)
4. **Cost vs benefit** (area, SRAM, performance tradeoffs)

### LOW Mode Limitations

**Why can't saturate even with 8 channels?**
- No pipelining (pipeline_depth = 1)
- Sequential bursts (max_outstanding = 1)
- Cycles per burst = latency + burst_length = 208 cycles
- 8 channels × 4.92 GB/s = **39.4 GB/s (68% of peak)**
- Would need **12 channels** to saturate

**Recommendation:** Upgrade to MEDIUM mode for 1.5x improvement

### MEDIUM Mode

**Why saturates with 8 channels?**
- 4-deep pipeline hides latency effectively
- Cycles per burst = (200/4) + 16 = **66 cycles**
- 8 channels × 7.2 GB/s > 57.6 GB/s → **saturated!**

**Recommendation:** Already optimal for typical use cases

### HIGH Mode

**Why single channel can't saturate?**
- SRAM capacity limits effective pipeline to 8 (not 16)
- 128 lines / 16 beats per burst = **8 bursts max**
- Cycles per burst = (200/8) + 16 = **41 cycles**
- Bandwidth = 24.98 GB/s (**43% of peak**)

**Why 8 channels saturate?**
- Channel aggregation: 8 × ~7.2 GB/s > 57.6 GB/s
- **Saturated at 4 channels!**

**Recommendation:**
- For single-channel saturation: Need 32x more SRAM (see PERFECT)
- For practical designs: Use 4-8 channels (current strategy)

### PERFECT Mode

**What's different?**
- **32x more SRAM** (4096 lines vs 128)
- Effective pipeline = 256 (unlimited by SRAM)
- Cycles per burst = (200/256) + 16 ≈ **17 cycles**
- Bandwidth = **61 GB/s** (exceeds AXI peak!)

**Result:** Single channel **saturates AXI bus**

**But why not use it?**
1. Area cost: 64 KB → 2048 KB total SRAM (32x increase)
2. No benefit: 8 channels still cap at 57.6 GB/s (same as HIGH)
3. Inefficient: Wastes SRAM for no throughput gain

## 4. Latency Sensitivity Analysis

### What It Shows

How performance varies with memory latency across different modes.

### Example: HIGH Mode

| Latency | Read BW | Limited By |
|---------|---------|------------|
| 50 cycles | 46.0 GB/s | SRAM capacity |
| 100 cycles | 35.9 GB/s | SRAM capacity |
| 200 cycles | 25.0 GB/s | SRAM capacity |
| 400 cycles | 15.5 GB/s | SRAM capacity |
| 800 cycles | 8.8 GB/s | SRAM capacity |

**Insight:** Even at low latencies, HIGH mode is SRAM-limited, not timing-limited!

### Example: PERFECT Mode

| Latency | Read BW | Limited By |
|---------|---------|------------|
| 50 cycles | 63.2 GB/s | AXI peak |
| 100 cycles | 61.9 GB/s | AXI peak |
| 200 cycles | 61.0 GB/s | AXI peak |
| 400 cycles | 60.2 GB/s | AXI peak |
| 800 cycles | 59.5 GB/s | AXI peak |

**Insight:** PERFECT mode maintains saturation across wide latency range due to deep pipeline

## 5. SRAM Sizing Guidance

### Requirements Table

| Mode | Pipeline Depth | SRAM Lines | SRAM KB | Effective Pipeline | Lines to Saturate (1ch) |
|------|----------------|------------|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| LOW | 1 | 128 | 8 | 1 | 163 |
| MEDIUM | 4 | 128 | 8 | 4 | 1799 |
| HIGH | 16 | 128 | 8 | **8** | 1799 |
| PERFECT | 256 | 4096 | 256 | 256 | 1799 |

**Key Insight:** To saturate with single channel at 1KB payload requires **~1800 lines** (112 KB), not the current 128 lines (8 KB)

### Design Tradeoffs Explained

**Current Design (HIGH mode):**
- 8 channels × 8 KB = **64 KB total**
- Strategy: **Channel parallelism**
- Result: Saturates bus with 4-8 channels

**Alternative (PERFECT mode):**
- 8 channels × 256 KB = **2048 KB total**
- Strategy: **Deep per-channel buffers**
- Result: Saturates bus with 1+ channels
- **Cost:** 32x more SRAM for **same total throughput**

**Conclusion:** Channel parallelism is more efficient!

## 8. Key Design Insights Documented

### Why Single Channel Can't Saturate in HIGH Mode

**Problem:**
- Payload = 1KB = 16 beats
- SRAM = 128 lines
- Only **8 bursts fit** in SRAM
- Effective pipeline limited to **8** (not 16)

**Result:**
- Cycles per burst = (200/8) + 16 = 41 cycles
- Bandwidth = 24.98 GB/s (**43% of peak**)

**Solution (PERFECT mode):**
- SRAM = 4096 lines
- **256 bursts fit** in SRAM
- Effective pipeline = 256
- Cycles per burst = (200/256) + 16 ≈ 17 cycles
- Bandwidth = **61 GB/s (saturated)**

**But cost:**
- 32x more SRAM (8 KB → 256 KB per channel)
- No benefit when using multiple channels

### Why Channel Parallelism is Preferred

**Option 1: Deep buffers (PERFECT mode)**
- 8 channels × 256 KB = **2048 KB total**
- Single channel can saturate: 61 GB/s
- 8 channels still limited to 57.6 GB/s (AXI peak)
- **Wasted SRAM**

**Option 2: Channel parallelism (HIGH mode)**
- 8 channels × 8 KB = **64 KB total**
- Single channel: 25 GB/s (not saturated)
- 8 channels: 57.6 GB/s (saturated)
- **32x less SRAM for same throughput!**

**Conclusion:** Channel parallelism wins on area efficiency

## 9. Report Use Cases

### For Design Reviews

**Question:** "Why can't a single channel saturate the bus?"

**Answer:** Point to bottleneck analysis report showing:
- SRAM capacity limits effective pipeline to 8
- Would need 1800 lines (vs 128) to saturate
- More efficient to use multiple channels

### For Performance Tuning

**Question:** "How do I improve LOW mode performance?"

**Answer:** Latency sensitivity report shows:
- Pipelining would reduce cycles per burst from 208 to 66
- Upgrade to MEDIUM mode gives 1.5x improvement
- Cost: 3x more pipeline depth, 4x more outstanding

### For Theoretical Analysis

**Question:** "What's the theoretical maximum single-channel performance?"

**Answer:** PERFECT mode analysis shows:
- 61 GB/s achievable (saturates AXI)
- Requires 256 KB SRAM per channel (32x increase)
- Not recommended due to diminishing returns

## 10. Dependencies

### New Dependency

**tabulate** - Required for pandas `to_markdown()` in reports

```bash
# Install in virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
pip install tabulate
```

**Or add to `requirements.txt`:**
```
tabulate==0.9.0
```
