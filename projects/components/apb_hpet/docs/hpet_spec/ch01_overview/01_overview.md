### APB HPET - Overview

#### Introduction

The APB High Precision Event Timer (HPET) is a configurable multi-timer peripheral designed for precise timing and event generation in embedded systems. It provides up to 8 independent hardware timers with one-shot and periodic modes, accessible via APB interface with optional clock domain crossing support.

#### Key Features

- **Multiple Independent Timers**: 2, 3, or 8 configurable hardware timers per instance
- **64-bit Main Counter**: High-resolution timestamp with configurable clock source
- **64-bit Comparators**: Long-duration timing support (up to 2^64-1 clock cycles)
- **Dual Operating Modes**:
  - **One-shot**: Timer fires once when counter reaches comparator value
  - **Periodic**: Timer auto-reloads and fires repeatedly at fixed intervals
- **Dynamic Mode Switching**: Switch between one-shot and periodic modes without reset
- **APB Interface**: Standard AMBA APB4 compliant register interface
- **Clock Domain Crossing**: Optional CDC support for independent APB and timer clocks
- **PeakRDL Integration**: Register map generated from SystemRDL specification
- **Per-Timer Write Data Buses**: Dedicated data paths prevent timer corruption
- **Individual Interrupts**: Separate interrupt output per timer with W1C status clearing

#### Applications

**Real-Time Operating Systems:**
- System tick generation for RTOS schedulers
- Watchdog timer implementation
- Task deadline enforcement
- Periodic interrupt generation

**Performance Profiling:**
- High-resolution timestamp source
- Code execution timing
- Cache miss profiling
- Inter-event timing measurement

**Multi-Rate Timing:**
- Multiple simultaneous timing domains
- Independent periodic tasks
- Asynchronous event generation
- Programmable pulse generation

**Industrial Control:**
- PWM generation base timer
- Motor control timing
- Sensor sampling intervals
- Control loop timing

#### Design Philosophy

**Configurability:**
The HPET component prioritizes configurability to support diverse use cases. Timer count, vendor ID, and CDC enablement are all parameterizable at synthesis time, allowing customization for specific applications without RTL changes.

**Reliability:**
Extensive testing (5/6 configurations at 100% pass rate) validates core functionality. The design includes per-timer data buses to prevent corruption and comprehensive error detection in configuration registers.

**Standards Compliance:**
- **APB Protocol**: Full AMBA APB4 specification compliance
- **PeakRDL**: Industry-standard SystemRDL for register generation
- **Reset Convention**: Consistent active-low asynchronous reset (`presetn`)

**Reusability:**
Clean module hierarchy and well-defined interfaces enable easy integration. Optional CDC support allows flexible clock domain configuration without design changes.

#### Comparison with IA-PC HPET

The APB HPET draws architectural inspiration from the IA-PC HPET specification (Intel/Microsoft) but is **not** a drop-in replacement. Key differences:

| Feature | IA-PC HPET | APB HPET |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Interface** | Memory-mapped | AMBA APB4 |
| **Timer Count** | Up to 256 | 2, 3, or 8 (configurable) |
| **FSB Delivery** | Supported | Not supported |
| **Legacy Replacement** | PIT/RTC emulation | Not supported |
| **Counter Size** | 64-bit mandatory | 64-bit |
| **Comparator Size** | 64-bit or 32-bit | 64-bit only |
| **Clock Source** | 10 MHz minimum | User-configurable |
| **Vendor ID** | Read from capability | Configurable parameter |

**Retained Concepts:**
- 64-bit free-running counter
- One-shot and periodic timer modes
- Write-1-to-clear interrupt status
- Capability register for hardware discovery

**Removed Features:**
- FSB interrupt delivery (use dedicated IRQ signals)
- Legacy PIT/RTC replacement (not needed in modern designs)
- Main counter period configuration (use clock divider instead)

#### Performance Characteristics

**Timing Accuracy:**
- Counter increment: Every HPET clock cycle (deterministic)
- Timer fire latency: 1 HPET clock cycle from counter match
- Interrupt assertion: Combinational (same cycle as timer fire)

**Register Access Latency:**
- No CDC: 2 APB clock cycles (APB protocol minimum)
- With CDC: 4-6 APB clock cycles (handshake synchronization overhead)

**Resource Utilization (Post-Synthesis Estimates):**
- 2-timer (no CDC): ~500 LUTs, ~300 flip-flops
- 3-timer (no CDC): ~650 LUTs, ~400 flip-flops
- 8-timer (with CDC): ~1200 LUTs, ~800 flip-flops

**Scalability:**
The design scales linearly with timer count. Each additional timer adds approximately:
- 150 LUTs (comparator, control logic, interrupt generation)
- 100 flip-flops (timer state, configuration registers)
- Minimal timing impact (no critical path through timer array)

#### Verification Status

**Test Coverage:** 5 of 6 configurations achieve 100% test pass rate

| Configuration | Basic | Medium | Full | Overall |
|---------------|-------|--------|------|---------|
| 2-timer Intel-like (no CDC) | 4/4 ✅ | 5/5 ✅ | 3/3 ✅ | 12/12 ✅ |
| 3-timer AMD-like (no CDC) | 4/4 ✅ | 5/5 ✅ | 3/3 ✅ | 12/12 ✅ |
| 8-timer custom (no CDC) | 4/4 ✅ | 5/5 ✅ | 2/3 ⚠️ | 11/12 ⚠️ |
| 2-timer Intel-like (CDC) | 4/4 ✅ | 5/5 ✅ | 3/3 ✅ | 12/12 ✅ |
| 3-timer AMD-like (CDC) | 4/4 ✅ | 5/5 ✅ | 3/3 ✅ | 12/12 ✅ |
| 8-timer custom (CDC) | 4/4 ✅ | 5/5 ✅ | 3/3 ✅ | 12/12 ✅ |

**Known Issue:** 8-timer non-CDC "All Timers Stress" test has timeout issue (minor, likely test configuration)

**Test Levels:**
- **Basic (4 tests)**: Register access, enable/disable, counter operation, interrupt generation
- **Medium (5 tests)**: Periodic mode, multiple timers, 64-bit features, mode switching
- **Full (3 tests)**: All timers stress, CDC validation, edge case coverage

**See:** `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` for complete test results
