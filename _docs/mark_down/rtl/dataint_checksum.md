The Generic Checksum Module is designed for calculating the checksum of incoming data streams in hardware. It supports a configurable data width and operates on a simple principle of summing the input data, which makes it suitable for a wide range of applications where data integrity needs to be ensured.

## Overview

This module calculates a running checksum of the input data presented to it. Each time valid data is input, the module adds this data to an internal accumulator (or count register). This running sum acts as the checksum, which is made available as an output. This process can be reset at any time, allowing for new checksum calculations to begin.

## Inputs and Outputs

- **i_clk**: The clock signal. The checksum calculation is synchronized to the rising edge of this clock.
- **i_rst_n**: Active low reset signal. Resets the internal state of the module.
- **i_reset**: Synchronous reset input. When asserted, it resets the checksum calculation to zero without needing to toggle the global reset signal.
- **i_valid**: Input data valid signal. Indicates when the data on the `i_data` input is valid and should be included in the checksum calculation.
- **i_data**: The input data. The width of this bus is determined by the `WIDTH` parameter. Each valid data word is added to the running checksum.
- **o_chksum**: The output checksum. This signal presents the current value of the checksum based on the data input so far.

## Parameters

- **WIDTH**: The width of the input data and checksum output, in bits. This parameter allows the module to be tailored to different data sizes, accommodating various application requirements.

## Inner Workings

1. **Accumulation**: On each clock cycle where `i_valid` is asserted, the value present on `i_data` is added to the internal running total (`r_count`). This running total serves as the checksum.
2. **Reset Handling**: The module can be reset in two ways:
   - A global asynchronous reset via `i_rst_n`.
   - A synchronous reset via `i_reset`, which can be used to reinitialize the checksum calculation without affecting the rest of the system.
3. **Checksum Output**: The current value of the checksum is continuously available on `o_chksum`, allowing for real-time monitoring or retrieval of the checksum value.

## Usage Scenario

This module is ideal for systems where data packets or streams need to be checked for integrity by summing the data values. For example, in a data transmission system, each packet's data could be checksummed before transmission and then checked at the receiver by recalculating the checksum and comparing it to a transmitted checksum.

## Conclusion

The Generic Checksum Module offers a straightforward yet flexible solution for hardware-based checksum calculations. Its parameterizable design ensures it can be integrated into a wide range of systems, providing a reliable method for data integrity verification.
