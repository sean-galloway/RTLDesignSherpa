The `math_adder_carry_lookahead` module is a parameterized Verilog module that implements a carry-lookahead adder (CLA) for binary addition. This adder uses parallelism to improve the speed of binary addition by reducing the carry propagation delay time compared to a ripple carry adder.

## Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs:**

- `i_a [N-1:0]`: An N-bit input vector representing the first operand of the addition.

- `i_b [N-1:0]`: An N-bit input vector representing the second operand of the addition.

- `i_c`: A single bit input representing the initial carry-in (usually 0 for the least significant bit in addition operation).

- **Outputs:**

- `ow_sum [N-1:0]`: An N-bit output vector that stores the sum result of the addition.

- `ow_carry`: A single bit output that stores the carry-out of the most significant bit.

## Parameters

- `N`: The width of the input and output vectors. The default value is 4, but it can be specified when the module is instantiated to accommodate larger bit-widths.

## Internal Functionality

- **Generate and propagate signals**: The module computes the generate `(w_g[i])` and propagate `(w_p[i])` signals for each bit position, which are intermediates required to compute the carry and sum bits. The generated signal is true if both bits `i_a[i]` and `i_b[i]` are 1, and the propagate signal is true if either `i_a[i]` or `i_b[i]` is 1.

- **Calculate carry bits**: The module calculates the carry for each bit position, which is required to compute the sum bits. The initial carry `w_c[0]` is set to the input carry `i_c`. Subsequent carry bits are generated by checking if the generate bit is set or if the propagate and previous carry bit are set.

- **Calculate sum bits**: The sum bits are calculated by XORing the two input bits `i_a[i]` and `i_b[i]` with the respective carry bit `w_c[i]`.

## Debugging (ifdef DEBUG)

If the `DEBUG` macro is defined, an `initial` block is included that displays the intermediate and final values of the adder's inputs, outputs, and internal signals. It waits for ten units before displaying the values to ensure they have settled.

To enable debugging output, ensure that the `DEBUG` macro is defined in your simulation environment. No command line options are needed within Verilog. However, in the simulation tool, you would typically add a compiler directive like `+define+DEBUG` or set it from within the tool's settings.

**Note**: The display statements are not synthesizable and are only meant for simulation.
