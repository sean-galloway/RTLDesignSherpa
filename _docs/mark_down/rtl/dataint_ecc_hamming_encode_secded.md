## Module Description

The `dataint_ecc_hamming_encode_secded` module is designed to encode input data using Hamming code with an additional Single Error Correction and Double Error Detection (SECDED) capability. It generates the necessary parity bits and an overall parity bit for the data block to enable error detection and correction at the decoding stage.

## Parameters

- `WIDTH`: Specifies the width of the input data.
- `DEBUG`: If set to 1, enables additional debug information output.

## Inputs

- `i_data`: Input data block that needs to be encoded, width defined by `WIDTH`.

## Outputs

- `ow_encoded_data`: Output data block that includes the input data, generated parity bits, and an overall parity bit for SECDED. The total width is `TotalWidth`.

## Local Parameters

- `ParityBits`: Calculated number of parity bits required for the given `WIDTH`, calculated as `$clog2(WIDTH + $clog2(WIDTH) + 1)`.
- `TotalWidth`: The total width of the encoded data, which is the sum of `WIDTH`, `ParityBits`, and 1 for the SECDED bit.

## Functionality

1. **Data Bit Positioning**: Maps input data bits to their corresponding positions in the output data block, skipping locations reserved for parity bits and the overall parity bit.
2. **Parity Bit Calculation**: For each parity bit, calculates its value based on the XOR of specific data bits that it covers, as defined by the Hamming code algorithm.
3. **Overall Parity Bit Calculation**: Generates an overall parity bit that covers the entire data block, including the newly computed parity bits, enabling the detection of double-bit errors.
4. **Output Generation**: Combines the input data, calculated parity bits, and overall parity bit into the `ow_encoded_data` output.

## Debugging

- When `DEBUG` is enabled, the module provides console outputs showing detailed operations, such as bit position calculations and parity bit generation, aiding in the debugging and verification process.

## Usage

This module is typically employed in communication systems, memory architectures, and other digital systems requiring robust error detection and correction capabilities. It ensures that data integrity can be maintained even in the presence of noise or faults that may introduce errors during data transmission or storage.
