A Wallace Tree multiplier is a hardware implementation that multiplies binary numbers quickly. It speeds up the process by overlapping the addition of partial products, reducing the overall number of sequential adding stages.

## Module Interface

- **Parameters**:

`N`: Specifies the width of the operands (Default: 8). It determines the input and output sizes through calculation.

- **Inputs**:

`input logic [N-1:0] i_multiplier`: The multiplier operand.

`input logic [N-1:0] i_multiplicand`: The multiplicand operand.

- **Outputs**:

`output logic [2*N-1:0] ow_product`: The resulting product of the multiplication.

## Internal Functionality

1\. **Partial Product Generation**: The module calculates 64 partial products corresponding to the bit-wise AND of `i_multiplier` and `i_multiplicand`.

2\. **Partial Product Reduction**: It employs a Wallace tree structure using half-adders (HA) and carry-save adders (CSA) to reduce the partial products to a sum and carry output.

3\. **Final Addition**: The final-stage adders process the reduced rows of sums and carries to produce the final product.

4\. **Product Assignment**: The individual bits of the final product are assigned to the output `ow_product[0]` through `ow_product[15]`.

**Note**: The code features a superior hierarchical structure, which is conducive to synthesis and implementation in hardware. However, the instantiation of other building blocks (like `math_adder_half` and `math_adder_carry_save`) suggests that external modules are expected to be used with this multiplier, although these are not provided within the code snippet. Users should ensure these modules are included in the design environment before synthesis and simulation.
