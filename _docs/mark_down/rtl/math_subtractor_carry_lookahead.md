This Verilog module implements a subtractor with a carry-lookahead feature to improve the performance of the subtraction operation by quickly determining the borrows. The module provides a generic way to subtract two binary numbers of width `N`.

## Parameters

- `int N`: Parameter that defines the width of the input and output vectors. This generic parameter allows the module to be configured for different bit widths during instantiation.

## Ports

- `input logic [N-1:0] i_a`: The `i_a` input port represents the minuend, the number from which another number (subtrahend) is to be subtracted.

- `input logic [N-1:0] i_b`: The `i_b` input port is the subtrahend, the number to be subtracted from the minuend.

- `input logic i_borrow_in`: The `i_borrow_in` input is the initial borrow flag, which can affect the result of the subtraction, often being zero if there is no prior borrow.

- `output logic [N-1:0] ow_difference`: The `ow_difference` output port carries the result of the subtraction operation.

- `output logic ow_carry_out`: The `ow_carry_out` output represents the borrow out (carry out) after subtraction. If it is set, it indicates a borrow from the most significant bit.

## Internal Functionality

- **Borrow Generation and Propagation**: The module calculates generate (`w_g`), propagate (`w_p`), and kill (`w_k`) signals for each bit of `i_a` and `i_b`. The generated signal indicates where a borrow is created, propagates where a borrow could propagate through and kills where a borrow would be prevented.

- **Lookahead Borrow Calculation**: It quickly computes the borrows across the entire bit width using the lookahead technique. This reduces possible delay chains that are typical in a ripple-carry subtractor.

- **Difference Calculation**: The difference for each bit is calculated using an XOR operation between bits of `i_a`, `i_b`, and the borrow from the previous bit stage.

- **Final Borrow Out Output**: Outputs the final borrow due to the subtraction operation.

### Notes

- This module optimizes subtraction for faster calculation times where quick borrow determination is essential, such as in high-speed arithmetic units.

- Be aware that while carry lookahead logic can speed up the operation, it does so at the cost of additional hardware complexity.
