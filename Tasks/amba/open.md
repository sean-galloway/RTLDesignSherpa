### TASK-014: Performance Characterization
**Priority:** P2
**Status:** 🔴 Not Started
**Owner:** TBD

**Description:**
Characterize resource utilization and performance impact of monitors.

**Metrics to Collect:**
- [ ] Area (LUT, FF, BRAM) per monitor type
- [ ] Timing impact (critical path analysis)
- [ ] Power consumption (if measurable)
- [ ] Comparison: AXI4 vs AXIL vs APB vs AXIS
- [ ] Comparison: With vs without clock gating

**Deliverable:**
- [ ] Performance characterization report
- [ ] Recommendations for resource-constrained designs
- [ ] Optimization opportunities identified

### TASK-015: Add Address Range and ID Filtering
**Priority:** P3
**Status:** 🔴 Not Started
**Owner:** TBD

**Description:**
Add optional filtering capabilities to reduce monitor packet traffic.

**Features:**
- [ ] Address range filtering (monitor only specific regions)
- [ ] Transaction ID filtering (monitor only specific masters)
- [ ] Configurable filter enable/disable
- [ ] Runtime filter updates

**Use Case:**
- Reduce packet congestion in high-traffic systems
- Focus monitoring on specific subsystems
- Debug-specific master/slave combinations

### TASK-022: Make APB Crossbar Variants Functional
**Priority:** P2
**Status:** 🔴 Not Started
**Owner:** TBD
**Effort:** Medium (2-3 days)
**Dependencies:** None (APB thin crossbar already works)

**Objective:** Get all APB crossbar variants working and tested

**Background:**
- APB thin crossbar (apb_xbar_thin_wrap) is functional and tested
- Buffered/full variants may have issues
- Need comprehensive testing of all variants

**Requirements:**

1. **Verify Thin Variant (Complete)**
   - ✅ test_apb_xbar thin variant PASSED
   - Works as baseline reference

2. **Fix/Verify Buffered Variants**
   - Test apb_xbar with buffering enabled
   - Identify and fix any issues
   - Verify backpressure handling

3. **Full Feature Testing**
   - Multiple masters × multiple slaves
   - Concurrent transactions
   - Address decoding
   - Error responses

4. **Documentation**
   - Document working variants
   - Configuration guidelines
   - Performance characteristics

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] All APB crossbar variants functional
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Configuration guide for variant selection
- [ ] Integration examples updated

**Success Criteria:**
- All APB crossbar tests passing
- Documented working configurations
- Clear guidance on variant selection

### TASK-024: Write Monitor System Whitepaper
**Priority:** P3
**Status:** 🔴 Not Started (stub created 2026-05-29)
**Owner:** Sean (author) / Claude (assist)
**Deliverable:** `docs/markdown/RTLAmba/monitor_system_whitepaper.md`
> Note (2026-07-22): the 2026-05-29 stub is not present in the current tree; recreate it when this task starts.

**Description:**
2-3 page whitepaper that frames the monitor system as a *design surface*
for SoC integrators -- not a status snapshot of what is in place, but a
guide to which knobs the integrator owns and how to spend them. Different
from `docs/markdown/RTLAmba/overview.md` (which describes the as-built
implementation) and from the per-module specs under `shared/` (which
describe specific blocks). This paper sits one level up: "here is the
spine, here are the axes, here are the tweaks."

**Section outline** (stub already in place):

1. **Identity space allocation** -- UNIT_ID / AGENT_ID / CHANNEL_ID as
   designer-owned. Includes the worked example of allocating UNIT_ID one
   level down so each unit gets up to 16 internal sub-busses to track.
2. **Where to insert monitoring** -- per-port (current default), mid-fabric
   (for localizing fabric-internal violations), root-of-tree (aggregate
   only, trades resolution for area).
3. **Timestamp policy** -- current locked to the monbus_group family's local
   counter. Future direction: hybrid `{global_us[47:0], local_cyc[15:0]}`
   so cross-subsystem correlation and per-wrapper resolution share the
   same 64-bit field. Also a note on PTP / external time-source variant.
4. **Drain path selection** -- err FIFO (IRQ) vs. write FIFO (bulk
   trace), per-packet-type routing via `cfg_*_err_select`.
5. **Packet-type filtering** -- masking strategy, the
   completion+performance congestion pitfall, runtime-reconfigurable
   masks via control APB.
6. **Aggregation topology** -- tree-of-arbiters default, WRR variant for
   skewed traffic, protocol-partitioned groups.

**Out of scope** for the whitepaper (covered elsewhere):
- Packet bit-layout (in `docs/markdown/RTLAmba/includes/monitor_package_spec.md`)
- Per-module port lists / timing (in `docs/markdown/RTLAmba/monitor/{module}.md`)
- Specific test recipes (in the relevant test source).

**Completion checklist** (already mirrored at the bottom of the stub):
- [ ] Pull representative deployment numbers from stream_char on
      Nexys A7 (perf-section figures).
- [ ] One block diagram per section showing as-built vs. tweaked
      configurations side-by-side.
- [ ] Cross-link each section to its per-module spec under `shared/`.
- [ ] Expand the timestamp section into an appendix once the
      hybrid-global scheme is prototyped.
- [ ] Add a verification section pointing at the slave-BFM error-
      injection pattern (`test_bridge_1x2_rd_monitor_error_inject.py`)
      as the template for validating tweaks in simulation.
