# multiplier_mixin

This Python module defines a `MultiplierMixin` class which contains methods used in generating Verilog code for multipliers, including Dadda, Wallace, and Booth radix-4 multipliers. The class is meant to be used as a mixin (hence the name), providing common functionality for more specific multiplier classes that would inherit from this.

## Partial Products Generator for Dadda/Wallace Multiplier

Generates partial products for a Dadda/Wallace multiplier. This method generates partial products for a Dadda multiplier by populating bit groups based on the given buswidth, N.

**Inputs/Outputs:**

- The method `partial_products` takes a single integer parameter `N`, which is used to determine the input/output buswidth of the multiplier.
- It returns a dictionary `bit_groups` where each key represents a bit position and the value is a list of generated signal names corresponding to that bit position.

**Internal Functionality:**

- The method generates partial products for each pair of bits in the multiplier and multiplicand.
- It uses `itertools.product` to iterate over all combinations of bit positions.
- Each partial product is formed by AND'ing the corresponding bits from the multiplier and multiplicand.
- The signal names for the partial products are formatted and stored in the `bit_groups` dictionary, to be accessed later in the multiplier construction process.

**Command Line Options:**
This Python class does not have direct command line options as it is meant to be included and used within a larger Python script or module that generates RTL (Register-Transfer Level) designs.

## Partial Products Generator for Booth Radix-4 Multiplier

**Inputs/Outputs:**

- Similar to the Dadda/Wallace generator, the Booth Radix-4 method takes an integer `N` for the buswidth and returns a dictionary `bit_groups`.
- In the Booth Radix-4 multiplier, partial products are generated differently, utilizing Booth encoding to handle groups of three bits at a time.

**Internal Functionality:**

- The method pads the input to ensure it is divisible by 3 for easier Booth encoding.
- Booth groups are formed and passed through a Booth encoder module to generate encoded values.
- The encoded values are then multiplied by the corresponding bits of the multiplicand to form partial products, which are added to the `bit_groups`.

## Final Addition Stage Generator

**Inputs/Outputs:**

- The method `generate_final_addition` receives a filled `bit_groups` dictionary and a buswidth `N`.
- It uses the information from `bit_groups` to generate the final addition stage of the multiplier.

**Internal Functionality:**

- Full adders are instantiated to add the partial product bits and carry bits from previous stages.
- Each bit position from the final addition is wired to the designated sum and carry outputs, ultimately building up the final product output bits.

---

## Final Products Assignment

**Inputs/Outputs:**

- This method does not return a value but generates Verilog `assign` statements that assign the final product bits to the output register.
- It takes the buswidth `N` to know how many bits to assign.

**Internal Functionality:**

- The method iterates over each bit position and assigns it to the corresponding bit of the multiplier's product output, using the sums calculated in the final addition stage.

The code does not explicitly show full class definitions or implementations for the Verilog generation, and it's intended that these methods would be part of a larger system that includes these definitions. Each method in the `MultiplierMixin` class assumes the existence of a `self.instruction` method that would be responsible for emitting the actual Verilog code lines, and a `self.comment` method for inserting comments in the generated Verilog.
