# Hamming ECC Encode Module (8-bit Example)

The Hamming ECC (Error Correcting Code) Encode Module is specifically designed to generate Hamming codes for error detection and correction in digital communication systems. This example demonstrates a module configured for an 8-bit data input, producing a 4-bit Hamming code. Note: any other size could be generated using the `ecc_generate.sh` script in the bin area. Currently, it is set up to generate 8 and 32-bit modules.

## Overview

Hamming codes are a family of linear error-correcting codes that can detect up to two-bit errors or correct one-bit errors without detection of uncorrected errors. The `dataint_ecc_hamming_encode_008` module implements the Hamming code generation for an 8-bit input data word, outputting a 4-bit ECC (Error Correction Code) that can be used to detect and correct errors in the data when it is read or received.

## Inputs and Outputs

- **i_data**: The input data signal. This is an 8-bit input representing the data word for which the ECC is to be generated.
- **o_ecc**: The output ECC signal. This is a 4-bit output representing the Hamming code generated based on the input data word.

## Parameters

- **N**: The width of the data input, is set to 8 bits in this example.
- **ECC**: The width of the ECC output, is set to 4 bits, which is appropriate for correcting single-bit errors in the 8-bit input data.

## Inner Workings

The module generates the ECC based on the input data using the following Hamming code formulae:

- **ECC Bit 3**: XOR of bits 7, 6, 4, 3, and 1 of the input data.
- **ECC Bit 2**: XOR of bits 7, 5, 4, 2, and 1 of the input data.
- **ECC Bit 1**: XOR of bits 6, 5, 4, and 0 of the input data.
- **ECC Bit 0**: XOR of bits 3, 2, 1, and 0 of the input data.

These ECC bits are specifically designed to cover different combinations of the input data bits, ensuring that single-bit errors can be detected and corrected.

## Usage Scenario

This module is particularly useful in memory systems, digital communication systems, or any application where data integrity is critical. The ECC generated can be appended to the data when stored or transmitted. Upon retrieval or reception, the data and ECC can be fed into a Hamming decode module to detect and correct any single-bit errors that may have occurred.

## Conclusion

The `dataint_ecc_hamming_encode_008` module provides an efficient means of generating Hamming codes for 8-bit data words, enhancing error detection and correction capabilities in digital systems. Its parameterized design allows for easy adaptation to other data sizes, making it a versatile tool for improving data reliability.
