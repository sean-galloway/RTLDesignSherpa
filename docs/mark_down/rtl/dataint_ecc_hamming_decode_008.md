# Hamming ECC Decode Module (8-bit Example)

The Hamming ECC Decode Module is designed to decode and correct errors in data encoded with Hamming codes. This example demonstrates a module configured for an 8-bit input data word and a 4-bit Hamming code, which can correct single-bit errors and detect double-bit errors. Note: any other size could be generated using the `ecc_generate.sh` script in the bin area. Currently, it is set up to generate 8 and 32-bit modules.

## Overview

The `dataint_ecc_hamming_decode_008` module decodes 8-bit data words encoded with a 4-bit Error Correction Code (ECC) generated by a Hamming encode module. It checks for errors in the data word, corrects single-bit errors, and indicates whether an error was detected and if it was repairable.

## Inputs and Outputs

- **i_data**: The 8-bit input data signal, representing the data word to be decoded and checked for errors.
- **i_ecc**: The 4-bit input ECC signal, representing the error correction code associated with the input data word.
- **o_data**: The 8-bit output data signal, representing the corrected data word after error checking and correction.
- **o_error**: A single-bit output signal that indicates if an error was detected in the input data.
- **o_repairable**: A single-bit output signal that indicates if the detected error could be repaired.

## Parameters

- **N**: The width of the data input and output, is set to 8 bits in this example.
- **ECC**: The width of the ECC input, is set to 4 bits, which is appropriate for correcting single-bit errors in the 8-bit data word.

## Inner Workings

### Syndrome Calculation

The module first calculates the syndrome based on the input data and ECC. The syndrome is used to determine if there are any errors in the data and the location of a single-bit error if present. Each bit of the syndrome is calculated as an XOR of specific bits from the input data and ECC, as defined by the Hamming code formulae.

### Data Repair

Based on the syndrome, the module then determines if the input data contains errors and attempts to correct single-bit errors by flipping the appropriate bit. The `o_error` signal is set to indicate if an error was detected, and the `o_repairable` signal indicates if the error could be corrected.

## Usage Scenario

This decode module is especially useful in systems where data integrity is critical, such as memory systems, digital communications, and error-tolerant applications. It ensures that errors introduced during data transmission or storage can be detected and corrected, thus enhancing the reliability of the system.

## Conclusion

The `dataint_ecc_hamming_decode_008` module provides a robust solution for error detection and correction in digital systems. Its capability to correct single-bit errors and detect double-bit errors makes it an essential component in improving data reliability and integrity.
