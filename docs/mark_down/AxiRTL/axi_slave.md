# axi_slave

The `axi_slave` module is a Verilog RTL description for an AXI4 slave interface that handles read and write transactions as specified by the AXI4 protocol. It employs skid buffers to handle back-pressure and provides an abstraction for memory-mapped operations. This module could be used in a system-on-chip (SoC) to interface with an AXI4 master module, such as a CPU core or a DMA controller.

## Module Parameters

- **AXI_ID_WIDTH (default=8)**: Width of the ID signal for AXI transactions.
- **AXI_ADDR_WIDTH (default=32)**: Width of the address signals.
- **AXI_DATA_WIDTH (default=32)**: Width of the data bus.
- **AXI_USER_WIDTH (default=1)**: Width of the user-defined signals in AXI.
- **AXI_WSTREB_WIDTH**: Width of the write strobe signals, derived from AXI_DATA_WIDTH.

### Ports

#### Global Signals

- `input logic aclk`: The global clock signal.
- `input logic aresetn`: The global active-low reset signal.

#### Write Address Channel (AW)

- **Inputs**: AXI slave accepts write address information from the AXI master.
- **Outputs**: AXI slave provides the write address ready signal back to the AXI master.

#### Write Data Channel (W)

- **Inputs**: AXI slave accepts write data, write strobes, and other associated control signals from the master.
- **Outputs**: AXI slave provides the write data ready signal back to the AXI master.

#### Write Response Channel (B)

- **Outputs**: AXI slave produces a response after a write operation to the AXI master.

#### Read Address Channel (AR)

- **Inputs**: AXI slave accepts read address information from the AXI master.
- **Outputs**: AXI slave provides read address ready signal to the AXI master.

#### Read Data Channel (R)

- **Outputs**: AXI slave sends read data and response to the AXI master.

#### Write and Read Fifo Channels

- **Outputs**: Signals related to an external FIFO interface for write and read transactions.
- **Inputs**: Signals related to an external FIFO interface for processing of incoming data and read responses.

### Description

- **Skid Buffers**: Instances of `axi_skid_buffer` are used to implement skid buffers for each of the AXI channels to smooth out data flow under back-pressure conditions.

- **Address Generation**: Instances of `axi_gen_addr` are used to generate next addresses for burst transfers in both write and read operations based on the current address, burst size, burst length, and burst type.

- **Write Operation**: Handles the write operations including address reception, data reception, and generating write responses.

- **Read Operation**: Handles read operations including address reception, data transmission back to the master, and generating read responses.

### Functionality

- The module accepts various AXI transactions and manages the necessary handshaking and buffering for concurrent operations.
- Internal signals and submodules facilitate skid buffering and data flow management.
- Address generation logic is included for handling different types of AXI bursts.
- The interface with external FIFOs enables further data processing or memory operations outside of the AXI protocol specifics.

### Usage

To use the module, instantiate it within an RTL design and connect the AXI master interface signals to the respective inputs and outputs. Additional logic may be needed to interface with memory or peripherals. The external FIFO interface can be used to connect this module to other stages of a processing pipeline or memory elements.

When synthesizing this module, ensure that all the necessary files, such as `axi_params.svh` (which seems to be commented out but would typically contain definitions for the AXI interface), and `axi_skid_buffer` and `axi_gen_addr` modules, are included in your compilation library.

### Code Conclusion

This Verilog module provides an implementation of an AXI4 slave interface with the required signals and buffering to handle write and read transactions. Its parameterized nature allows for adjusting the widths of various AXI signals.

Verify that all dependent modules (`axi_skid_buffer`, `axi_gen_addr`) and files are available and included in the build process for successful synthesis and simulation of the `axi_slave` module in an ASIC or FPGA environment.

Remember to provide all the necessary clocking, reset, and signal connections when instantiating this module in a larger design.
