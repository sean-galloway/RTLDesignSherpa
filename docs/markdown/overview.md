## Framework Architecture

### Design Philosophy

The framework is built on four core principles that reflect modern industry practices:

**1. Verification-Driven Development**
Every RTL module includes comprehensive test suites from the outset. This isn't an afterthoughtâ€”it's the foundation of the development process. Each module includes:
- Unit tests covering all parameter combinations
- Edge case testing and boundary condition validation
- Performance characterization across frequency ranges
- Protocol compliance verification where applicable

**2. Automated Quality Assurance**
Code quality is maintained through automated tools integrated into the development flow:
- **Verible Integration**: Automated linting and style checking ensure consistent code quality
- **Regression Testing**: Automated nightly runs with comprehensive reporting
- **Coverage Analysis**: Both code and functional coverage tracking
- **Documentation Generation**: Automated waveform and timing diagram creation

**3. Modular IP Architecture**
The framework emphasizes reusable, parameterized IP blocks:
- **Interface-Based Design**: Clean abstraction using SystemVerilog interfaces
- **Parameter-Driven Configuration**: Modules adapt to various system requirements
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Clear separation of concerns and dependencies
- **Protocol Compliance**: Full adherence to industry standards (AMBA, etc.)

**4. Professional Development Practices**
The toolchain and workflows mirror those used in commercial IC development:
- **Version Control Integration**: Git-based workflows with automated testing
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing on code changes
- **Documentation Standards**: Comprehensive module documentation with examples
- **Performance Analysis**: Timing, area, and power characterization
