## Functionality

The module provides the following key functionalities:

### Transaction Buffering and Flow Control

1. **Address Channel Buffering**: 
   - The AW channel skid buffer stores incoming write address transactions.
   - Provides decoupling between master and slave interfaces.
   - Enables clean timing closure and improved throughput.

2. **Data Channel Buffering**:
   - The W channel skid buffer stores incoming write data.
   - Provides decoupling between master and slave interfaces.
   - Enables handling of variable-timing data transfers.

3. **Response Channel Buffering**:
   - The B channel skid buffer stores outgoing write responses.
   - Provides decoupling between master and slave interfaces.
   - Enables proper handling of response timing.

### Error Monitoring

An error monitoring subsystem (`axi_errmon_base`) tracks:
- Address timeouts: When AW channel transactions don't complete within the specified timeout.
- Data timeouts: When W channel transactions don't complete within the specified timeout.
- Response timeouts: When B channel transactions don't complete within the specified timeout.
- Response errors: When write responses indicate an error condition (SLVERR or DECERR).

### Flow Control

The module implements flow control mechanisms:
- Monitoring of buffer fill levels to prevent overflow.
- Throttling of incoming transactions when necessary.
- Proper backpressure signaling to both master and slave interfaces.

## Implementation Details

### Top-Level Architecture

The module consists of four main components:

1. **Error Monitor**: An instance of `axi_errmon_base` that monitors the write channels for timeout conditions and error responses.

2. **AW Channel Skid Buffer**: A skid buffer that handles write address transactions from the master interface to the slave interface.

3. **W Channel Skid Buffer**: A skid buffer that handles write data from the master interface to the slave interface.

4. **B Channel Skid Buffer**: A skid buffer that handles write responses from the slave interface to the master interface.

### Error Monitor Integration

The error monitor is connected as follows:

1. Monitors AW, W, and B channel handshaking signals to detect timeouts.
2. Monitors B channel response codes to detect error responses.
3. Provides flow control through the `int_block_ready` signal to prevent new transactions when the error FIFO is full.
4. Reports detected errors through a dedicated FIFO interface.

### Skid Buffer Operation

The skid buffers operate as follows:

1. **AW Channel**: 
   - Accepts write address transactions from the master interface.
   - Holds transactions when the slave interface is not ready.
   - Forwards transactions to the slave interface when it becomes ready.

2. **W Channel**:
   - Accepts write data from the master interface.
   - Holds data when the slave interface is not ready.
   - Forwards data to the slave interface when it becomes ready.

3. **B Channel**:
   - Accepts write responses from the slave interface.
   - Holds responses when the master interface is not ready.
   - Forwards responses to the master interface when it becomes ready.

## Usage Considerations

1. **Buffer Sizing**:
   - Adjust skid buffer depths based on expected traffic patterns.
   - Consider the impact of buffer depth on latency and area.
   - The W channel typically benefits from a deeper buffer compared to AW and B channels.

2. **Timeout Configuration**:
   - Set timeout values based on expected system latencies.
   - Consider the impact of timeout values on error detection sensitivity.
   - The B channel timeout should account for memory or peripheral write completion time.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement proper handling for errors reported through the error FIFO interface.
   - Consider implementing retry mechanisms for recoverable errors.

4. **Integration with Memory Controller**:
   - Connect the slave interface to a memory controller or other backend logic.
   - Ensure the backend logic can handle the expected traffic patterns.

## Integration Example

```systemverilog
axi_slave_wr #(
    .AXI_DATA_WIDTH(64),            // 64-bit data bus
    .SKID_DEPTH_W(8),               // Deeper W skid buffer
    .TIMEOUT_B(2000)                // Longer B timeout
) i_axi_slave_wr (
    .aclk(system_clock),
    .aresetn(system_reset_n),
    
    // Connect master side (from AXI interconnect or master)
    // ... (connection of all master-side AXI signals) ...
    
    // Connect slave side (to memory controller or backend logic)
    // ... (connection of all slave-side AXI signals) ...
    
    // Error handling
    .fub_error_valid(wr_error_valid),
    .fub_error_ready(wr_error_ready),
    .fub_error_type(wr_error_type),
    .fub_error_addr(wr_error_addr),
    .fub_error_id(wr_error_id)
);
```

## Performance Optimization

1. **Buffer Depth Tuning**:
   - Monitor transaction patterns in your application.
   - Increase buffer depths for channels with bursty traffic.
   - Consider different depths for AW, W, and B channels based on their characteristics.

2. **Timeout Customization**:
   - Adjust timeout values based on observed system latencies.
   - Set longer timeouts for systems with variable memory access times.

3. **Pipelining Considerations**:
   - The skid buffers add pipeline stages to the data path.
   - Consider the impact on overall system latency.
   - Balance pipeline stages throughout the system for optimal performance.
