# APB Components

## Overview

The APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) components provide a complete implementation for building and testing APB-compliant interfaces within a verification environment. These components include master and slave drivers, monitors, packets, sequences, and factory functions to simplify test development.

## Key Features

- Complete APB protocol implementation
- Flexible packet structure with field-based configuration
- Master and slave drivers with customizable timing behavior
- Comprehensive test sequence generation
- Factory functions for quick component setup
- Register testing capabilities

## Components

- [APB Components](apb_components.md) - Core APB master, slave, and monitor implementation
- [APB Packet](apb_packet.md) - Protocol packet structure for APB transactions
- [APB Sequence](apb_sequence.md) - Sequence generation for testing APB interfaces
- [APB Factories](apb_factories.md) - Factory functions for creating APB components
- [Enhanced APB Factories](enhanced_apb_factories.md) - Advanced factory functions with register testing support
