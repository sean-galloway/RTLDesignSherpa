## Success Criteria

Each checklist item should meet these criteria when marked complete:
- ✅ **Functional**: Feature works as designed
- ✅ **Tested**: Automated test validates the functionality  
- ✅ **Documented**: Basic documentation exists
- ✅ **Reproducible**: Results are consistent across runs
- ✅ **Integrated**: Works with rest of system

## Implementation Notes

### Phase Dependencies
- Each phase builds on previous phases
- Phase 1 must be complete before starting Phase 2
- Phase 2 completion required for Phase 3
- Phases 4-5 can begin once Phase 3 basic functionality is working
- Phase 6 requires substantial completion of Phases 1-5
- Phase 7 is ongoing throughout but intensifies near completion

### Session Planning
- Individual checklist items are sized for single prompt sessions
- Critical path items marked in **bold** should be prioritized
- Some items within phases may be parallelizable once dependencies are met
- Estimate 1-3 prompt sessions per checklist item depending on complexity

### Testing Strategy
- Start with simplest possible tests that validate basic connectivity
- Add complexity incrementally (single transaction → burst → multiple concurrent)
- Use FlexRandomizer for stress testing once basic functionality is proven
- Maintain regression test suite that can be run frequently

### Debug and Troubleshooting
- Enable super_debug and pipeline_debug features early for visibility
- Use scoreboard reporting extensively to correlate RTL and Python state
- Monitor bus packets provide excellent debug visibility into RTL behavior
- Ready controller statistics help debug timing-related issues

### Quality Gates
- Each phase should have a defined "done" criteria
- Automated tests should cover all checked-off functionality
- Regular regression testing to catch integration issues
- Documentation should be updated as features are completed
