# FIFO Testbench Components Overview

The FIFO testbench directory contains a comprehensive suite of testbench classes designed for verification of various FIFO (First-In-First-Out) implementations. These testbenches provide scalable, configurable, and robust verification environments for FIFO designs ranging from simple single-signal interfaces to complex multi-channel data collection systems.

## Architecture Philosophy

The FIFO testbench suite is built on the CocoTBFramework's modular architecture, emphasizing:

**Modularity**: Each testbench focuses on specific FIFO characteristics while sharing common infrastructure
**Configurability**: Extensive environment variable support for parameterization
**Scalability**: Support for various data widths, depths, and complexity levels
**Reusability**: Common base classes and shared component patterns
**Modern Design**: Integration with FlexConfigGen for advanced randomization
