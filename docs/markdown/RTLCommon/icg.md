# icg (Integrated Clock Gating)

This SystemVerilog module implements a basic Integrated Clock Gating (ICG) cell. According to the code comment, it follows approaches described in "Low Power Design Methodologies and Flows".

## Module Parameters

None.

## Ports

Inputs:

- `en`: The enable signal that controls clock gating.
- `clk`: The input clock signal.

Outputs:

- `gclk`: The gated clock output.

## Functionality

1. **Latch-Based Approach**:
   - The module uses a level-sensitive latch (`always_latch`) that samples the enable signal when the clock is low.
   - This prevents glitches that could occur if using pure combinational logic for clock gating.

2. **Clock Gating Logic**:
   - The gated clock output (`gclk`) is generated by ANDing the latched enable signal (`en_out`) with the input clock (`clk`).
   - When `en_out` is 0, the clock is gated (blocked), and `gclk` remains low.
   - When `en_out` is 1, the clock passes through, and `gclk` follows `clk`.

## Implementation Notes

- The latch-based approach is a standard technique for clock gating, ensuring that the enable signal changes only when the clock is low to prevent clock glitches.
- This implementation is compact and serves as a basic building block for power optimization strategies.
- Clock gating is commonly used to reduce dynamic power consumption by preventing unnecessary clock toggling in inactive circuit blocks.

## Usage Considerations

- This module should be instantiated at clock domain boundaries where power savings are desired.
- Proper timing constraints should be applied to ensure the latched enable signal settles before the rising edge of the clock.
- The module should ideally be mapped to dedicated clock gating cells in the target technology during synthesis for optimal implementation.
