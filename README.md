# RTL_Design_Projects
This Repo is intended to show the progress I make as I venture into experimenting with FPGA's and  RTL Design experiments.

Each project will be self-contained in it's own directory. It is possible that some code is copied into multiple directories. Finally, each project will have a difficulty rating as indicated by the number of X's at the end of the name.
