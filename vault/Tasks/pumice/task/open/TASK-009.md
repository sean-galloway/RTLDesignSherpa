# TASK-009: doc + filelist cleanup (push from workstation)
> **Was `PUMICE-CLEANUP (via PUMICE-050)` until 2026-09-24.** Renamed when this area adopted per-lane ID sequences. Older references, commit messages and handbook notes use the old ID.


**Status:** open 2026-07-24 — deferred (project cleanup; see TOOL-010)
**Priority:** P2

Apply the RTL-area cleanup pattern to pumice: doc placement ([[doc-placement]])
and filelist consistency ([[filelists]] — the `dv/tb/*_tb_top.f` move into a
`filelists/` dir co-located with the testbench).

**Pushing: Sean pushes pumice from the workstation, NOT from the agent
environment (Sean, 2026-07-24).** Make and commit the pumice changes here if
working, but leave the push to Sean. Do not `git push` pumice work from this
box. (Reason per Sean — workstation is where pumice is pushed from.)

Gated behind the RTL area completing (Tasks/INDEX.md sequencing).
