# TASK-004: misc placement pass: FUTURE.md is a work list at the component root

**Priority:** P3
**Status:** open
**Owner:** misc session
**Filed:** 2026-09-28 by tooling TASK-004 (fan-out)

## Filelists

None loose.

## Markdown outside the book (1)

`FUTURE.md` -- planned work lives in this lane as tasks, not in a file beside
the RTL. File each entry that is still wanted as a `misc TASK-nnn` and delete
the page.

## Why this is filed here and not on tooling

Tooling TASK-004 (project-area cleanup) closed 2026-09-28 with the GLOBAL
mechanism in place: `bin/filelist_registry.py --placement` (ratcheted in CI,
baseline `bin/filelist_placement_baseline.json`) and the placement rules in
[[filelists]] and [[doc-placement]]. Per Sean (2026-09-28): an item that needs
edits inside many separate units is filed on each unit, or it never completes.
This is the per-unit share; nobody outside this unit will do it.

## Rules to apply (do not restate them here -- the notes are canonical)

- [[doc-placement]]: method/practice -> `vault/handbook/`; reader-facing
  pages -> this component's `docs/` book or `docs/markdown/`; work items,
  status pages, plans and "summary" files -> `vault/Tasks/<lane>/` (or delete
  when stale -- git keeps the history); a file the tooling READS stays put;
  beside-code `CLAUDE.md` / `PRD.md` / `README.md` stay, and a README is a
  link page, never a second copy of the spec.
- [[filelists]]: every `.f` in the owning dir's `filelists/` subdir
  (`rtl/<block>/filelists/`, `dv/filelists/` for a TB wrapper). After moving
  one, update every referrer (`filelist_path=`, tcl, README trees,
  `bin/filelists.toml` `filelist_dirs`), run `python3 bin/filelist_registry.py
  --check --audit`, then `--placement --update-placement-baseline` so the
  ratchet shrinks, and re-run the affected tests from `make clean-all`.

## Done when

- [ ] every file below has a decided home and is there (or is deleted with the
      reason in the commit message)
- [ ] `python3 bin/filelist_registry.py --placement` lists nothing from this unit
- [ ] the affected tests pass from `make clean-all`
