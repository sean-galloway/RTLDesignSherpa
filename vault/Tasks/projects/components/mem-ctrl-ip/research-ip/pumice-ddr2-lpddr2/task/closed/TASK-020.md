**Status:** closed — resolved via external converter

Make host `AXI_DATA_WIDTH` a free parameter (32/64/128/256/512) decoupled from
the core width `DW = DRAM_BEAT_WIDTH x DFI_RATE`. Family-wide
(DDR2/3/4/LPDDR2), for future DDR* IP where each device/PHY pins its own
(beat, rate) but the host SoC wants a fixed convenient AXI width.

Implemented via the EXTERNAL formally-verified `axi4_dwidth_converter_wr/_rd`
in a wrapper `rtl/top/pumice_top_geared.sv` (host width <-> DW; GEAR-1 =
generate bypass, bit-identical). Core datapath untouched. Verified end-to-end
(`test_pumice_top_geared.py`): write bursts at host in {64, 128, 256}
round-trip back through host-width reads (down-gear / bypass / up-gear).

Chose external over the internal gearbox because the datapath was freshly
stabilized and the converters are already formal; also the rearchitecture
already solved the original a7ddrphy forcing function (AXI = beat x rate = 128,
a fine width — no gearing needed for the board).

Design + rationale + deferred internal-gearbox option:
