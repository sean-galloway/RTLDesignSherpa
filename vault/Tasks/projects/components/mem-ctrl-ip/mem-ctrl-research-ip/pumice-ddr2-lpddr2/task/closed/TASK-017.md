**Status:** closed 2026-07-21 — reads clean on silicon; residual corruption split out to PUMICE-004

The rate-2/BL4 board (BUILD_ID 0x44445232) reads CLEAN. The blocker was never
the analog read path; it was three stacked measurement/config defects:

1. **Sweep axis.** s7ddrphy asserts `rddata_valid` a FIXED `read_latency`
   (= cl_sys+6 = 8) sys cycles after `rddata_en` (pure delay line; ISERDES
   capture is continuous), so for reads `t_rddata_en` only places valid. The
   DATA arrives at its own physical latency — `DFI_TUNING.rddata_delay` slides
   the data onto the valid window. Every failed sweep held rddata_delay=0 where
   alignment is unreachable. **Validated tuple: t_phy_wrlat=1, t_rddata_en=6,
   rddata_delay=7, bitslip=0, IDELAY tap 8 (eye taps 0..16, width 17).** Baked
   into the A7Leveling ctor defaults.
2. **False-pass metric.** `wait_engine` default bails when rd_error latches (a
   mismatch latches it) -> `beats_mismatched` read EARLY; and a HUNG read counts
   nothing -> reads back 0 = fake clean. Fixed in bringup_joint_probe /
   `A7Leveling._test` / train_per_lane (ignore_error=True + require done; hang
   reported distinctly).
3. **RMW poison.** On pre-CDC-fix bitstreams the pumice APB window returns a
   PRIOR transaction's data, so every `rmw=True` write spliced stale garbage
   into preserved fields (set_deskew after set_controller_cfg silently reverted
   wrlat/rden -> leveling swept at reset timing). pumice_device now NEVER rmws:
   shadowed full-word writes seeded from RDL resets, `invalidate_shadow()` on
   soft_reset. (RTL CDC fix already landed in `apb4_slave_cdc`; bitstreams in
   `bitstream/` predate it — rebuild to retire the hazard on-silicon.)

Residual intermittent row-sized (256-beat/2KB) read corruption, strongly
refresh-correlated (soak A/B: tREFI default 0/8 dirty, tREFI=0x40 4/4 dirty at
~32-44/1024 beats, tREFI=0xFFFF 0/8) is a separate defect — split out to
PUMICE-004, now confirmed on silicon.
