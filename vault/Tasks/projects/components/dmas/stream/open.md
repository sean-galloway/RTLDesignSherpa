### TASK-058: Signal contracts + K-maps for the significant STREAM signals (prove-by-construction)

**Priority:** High
**Status:** [~] In progress (2026-07-29) — the canonical workbook already existed
(`projects/components/dmas/stream/docs/gen_signal_contracts_kmaps.py` ->
`stream_signal_contracts.xlsx`); this session brought it CURRENT: added the
`w_addrgen_start` decider K-map (the TASK-059 fix) + `w_is_ext` contract, fixed
the citation drift my scheduler edit caused (24 `CITES` line refs) so
`verify_citations` is green again, and recorded the explicit placement rule in
the canonical note [[signal-contracts-and-kmaps]] (component `docs/`, one per
block, update-in-place — the gap that nearly caused a duplicate). Remaining: the
run-base-generator flush-on-start (invariant **I10** below) and optional formal
SVA of the stated invariants.

**Goal:** Maintain explicit **signal contracts** and **Karnaugh maps** for the
significant control/handshake signals in STREAM — **especially in the read and
write engines** (`axi_read_engine.sv`, `axi_write_engine.sv`) and the scheduler /
descriptor-engine / SRAM-controller handshakes — so the design is provably
correct **by construction** rather than only by directed test.

**Why:** STREAM has already produced several *interaction* bugs that a per-signal
contract would have forbidden up front, not caught after the fact — the
WLAST/drain lost-beat deadlock, the SRAM drain double-count deadlock, and now
the extended chained-transpose corruption (TASK-059 / known_issues). Each was a
cross-block pipeline hazard: a signal asserted (or sampled) one cycle off, or a
shared config register aliased across descriptors. A written contract per signal
(producer, consumer, valid window, mutual-exclusion / one-hot invariants,
back-to-back and reset behaviour) plus a K-map for the combinational deciders
turns these into things that are wrong *on paper* before they ship.

**Scope (significant signals — at least):**
- Engine handshakes: `m_axi_*valid/ready`, `*last`, the SRAM `drain`/`valid`
  pair, per-channel `grant`/`req`, `w_active`/registered-valid gating.
- Scheduler FSM enters/exits and the write-completion timeout.
- Descriptor-engine prefetch + extended `chunk1` fetch (`w_want_ext`,
  `g_ext_fifo`) and the `stream_run_addr_gen` config-latch enables.
- Address generation stride/index/wrap deciders (K-map the mode selection:
  burst vs per-beat, wrap on/off).

**Deliverable:** a contract note per significant signal (table: producer /
consumers / valid window / invariants / reset) and K-maps for the combinational
deciders, landed under the STREAM docs tree (HAS/MAS or a dedicated
`signal_contracts/` area) and indexed. Cross-link each contract to the RTL line
and to any known_issue it would have prevented.

**Related follow-up (from TASK-059's fix):** the run-base generator
(`stream_run_addr_gen`) can still retain queued bases if an extended descriptor
is aborted mid-generation by channel reset (channel reset does not reach that
block). A flush-on-start (`gaxi_drop_fifo_sync` `drop_all`) would close it; a
first attempt regressed the working cases on a flush/read-timing interaction and
was reverted. Low-severity latent robustness item — a good candidate for the
signal-contract treatment.
