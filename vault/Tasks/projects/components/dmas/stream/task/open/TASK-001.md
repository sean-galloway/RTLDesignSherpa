# TASK-001: finish the STREAM workbook so its maps prove the decisions
> **Was `STREAM-KMAP` until 2026-09-24.** Renamed when this area adopted per-lane ID sequences. Older references, commit messages and handbook notes use the old ID.

**Status:** open 2026-08-06  **Blocked on:** [[TOOLING-KMAP]] items 1-4

`projects/components/dmas/stream/docs/gen_signal_contracts_kmaps.py` is the
better of the two existing workbooks and still meets only two of the six
criteria in [[signal-contracts-and-kmaps]]: Gray-ordered, computed from cited
RTL -- but no axis equations, no sufficiency argument, no don't-cares, no
implicants. Its first pass found six defects the test suite had not, which is
the argument for FINISHING it, not for calling it done.

It already has per-block builders (`build_rd_engine_kmaps`,
`build_wr_engine_kmaps`, `build_scheduler_kmaps`, `build_desc_engine_kmaps`),
so the work is deepening each rather than starting over.

Priority targets, each with a silicon bug or known_issues entry behind it:

1. **Monitor cfg -> packet-class qualification (`stream_core`). DO THIS FIRST.**
   `cfg_compl_enable` was aliased to `int_cfg_*_mon_enable` and
   `cfg_threshold_enable` to `*_mon_perf_enable`. An axis table carrying each
   axis's DEFINING EXPRESSION would have shown two axes resolving to the same
   signal, immediately. Nothing in the test suite could see it (the FUB tests
   drive the ports directly; the board only sees packets). Small map, live
   failure, and the clearest possible demonstration of criterion 3.
2. **`axi_write_engine` drain strobe / WLAST.** The lost-WLAST deadlock was the
   SRAM drain decoupled from `m_axi_wvalid`; fixed by gating
   `axi_wr_sram_drain` on `m_axi_wvalid && m_axi_wready`. A map of the drain
   strobe with a stated sufficiency argument is the direct check, and
   `wr_w=burst_pause` remains the regression sentinel.
3. **`descriptor_engine` prefetch + fifo_threshold.** `cfg_prefetch_enable` and
   the fifo-threshold input were DEAD -- wired nowhere. A map listing axis
   equations with citations would have shown an axis that no RTL drives.
4. **`scheduler` timeout/error latch and clear.** A sticky CH_ERROR stranding
   the desc_fifo is exactly a latch/clear adjacency question. Note this is the
   SCHEDULER timeout (`SCHED_TIMEOUT_CYCLES`), NOT the monitor timeout -- two
   different mechanisms sharing a word, which is how the monitor's went
   untested at this level for so long.
5. **`stream_alloc_ctrl` / `stream_drain_ctrl` space accounting.** Credit-style
   arithmetic with unreachable regions that are only unreachable because of
   ordering guarantees elsewhere -- those guarantees belong in the don't-care
   citations (criterion 5).

Acceptance: every map above states its axis equations with citations, its
`depends_only_on` argument, its don't-cares with the invariant that makes them
unreachable, and a derived-minimal-vs-RTL verdict.
