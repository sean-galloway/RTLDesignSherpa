# TASK-003: scrub the tests for completeness (rapids)
> **Was `TASK-080` until 2026-09-24.** Renamed when this area adopted per-lane ID sequences. Older references, commit messages and handbook notes use the old ID.

**Priority:** P2. Blocks the coverage/formal push, not day-to-day work.
**Status:** open 2026-09-04. Raised by Sean: test scrubbing was meant to be
part of the kimi review packets and got dropped along the way. Applies to the
components suites as well as rtl/.

**ID note:** this area draws from the shared `TASK-nnn` sequence, whose
counter lives in [amba/INDEX.md](../../../../../../amba/INDEX.md). It is not a
per-area namespace -- take the number from there and bump it.

**Sequencing.** A FOCUSED pass, run after qc/humanize is finished everywhere
and BEFORE coverage and formal are driven clean.

**Scope:** `projects/components/dmas/rapids/dv/tests/` -- 17 test files.

**The capability already exists and was simply never run here.**
`bin/review/run_batch.py` has a `testqc` mode alongside `qc` and `humanize`,
with `bin/review/TEST_REVIEWER_BRIEF.md` as its brief and
`bin/review/build_test_review_bundle.py` to build the units.

**Why this is not busywork.** A test that passes because the RTL is broken is
worse than no test. The template is apb5 (2026-09-04): nothing drove
`rsp_ready`, so the response skid filled and never drained, and the TB's
completion check returned True on exactly the state the defect produced. The
suite was green BECAUSE the RTL was broken.

**Area-specific:** rapids has not been functional for roughly two months and
work resumes only after qc/humanize, the flat-flow migration and formal are
done (Sean, 2026-09-03). Do NOT start this scrub before the area is live
again -- auditing tests against RTL that is about to change is wasted effort.
This block exists so the requirement is recorded, not so it gets picked up
early.
**What "complete" has to mean, at minimum:**

- Every `test_*.py` actually exercises the DUT it names.
- No test asserts a condition the bug itself satisfies.
- Inputs the DUT needs are actually driven.
- gate/func/full levels mean something distinct, not three names for one run.
- No `run()` call pins `testcase=` to a single cocotb test. A pinned
  `testcase=` silently hides every OTHER `@cocotb.test` in that module, so a
  test can sit in the file for months and never execute. `test_apb5_master.py`
  did exactly this (2026-09-04) -- a witness added beside the basic test ran
  zero times until the pin was widened. A comma-separated list is the fix when
  a pin is genuinely wanted.
- A fix landed with a test has a mutation check recorded: the test was seen
  RED against the unfixed RTL. Without that the test is decoration.

**Related:** [[TASK-078]], [[COMMON-025]], [[MATH-010]], [[CDC-001]] are the
same task in the rtl/ areas.
