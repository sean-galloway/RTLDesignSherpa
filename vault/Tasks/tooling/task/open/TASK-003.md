# TASK-003: Two real gaps in the RDS-DV arbiter BFM

> Migrated 2026-09-27 from `vault/Tasks/tooling/open.md` as **TOOL-007** (tooling TOOL-001). The flat page did not record a lane; this item was placed by hand. Body preserved as written -- only the H1 and this line are new.
**Priority:** P2
**Status:** Not Started
**Owner:** TBD

Found while fixing COMMON-012. Both belong in the RTLDesignSherpa-DV repo, not
here; file them there and reference this task.

- [ ] **`ArbiterCompliance.analyze_round_robin_compliance()` is a stub.** It
      returns a hardcoded `{'rr_efficiency': 1.0, ...}` regardless of the
      observed grant sequence — see `components/shared/arbiter_compliance.py`.
      It is the one check whose name promises to catch a rotation defect, and
      it cannot. A clean report from it is not evidence of anything. Either
      implement it against the grant history the monitor already records, or
      make it return `{'status': 'not_implemented'}` so callers cannot mistake
      it for a pass. `detect_burst_behavior()` is stubbed the same way
      (`bursts_detected: 0` hardcoded).
- [ ] **`ArbiterMaster` cannot saturate via a profile.** Its
      `_setup_default_profiles` defines a private set (`default`, `fast`,
      `slow`, `disabled`, `manual`) that is not wired to `FlexConfigGen`, whose
      `DEFAULT_PROFILES` already contains `backtoback` = `[(0,0)]` = zero delay.
      Even `fast` carries a 1-3 cycle `inter_request_delay`, so all-clients-up
      never sustains and arbiter tests silently under-stress. Workaround in use:
      `force_client_request(c, enable=True)`. Wire the shared catalogue in, or
      add a saturating profile.

Why this matters beyond tidiness: the combination of these two is what let a
round-robin arbiter that starved half its clients pass its own testbench. See
[[randomization]].
