**Status:** closed — resolved

`addr_mapper.sv` is now driven by ONE knob — `ADDR_MAP.bank_lsb` (the CSR
register that replaced the old scheme selector) — plus an optional bank
XOR-hash (`ADDR_MAP.hash_en`/`hash_seed`). The mapping is derived by stacking
fields around the bank position: `col_lo(bank_lsb) | bank | col_hi | row | rank`,
row LSB invariant at `CW+BW`. The classic schemes are just settings, no scheme
mux: `bank_lsb == COL_WIDTH` = ROW_MAJOR; `bank_lsb == log2(cols/burst)` = max
BANK_INTERLEAVE (burst locality preserved by col_lo); `hash_en` = XOR_HASH on
top.

Landed: RDL ADDR_MAP register (regenerated CSR + regmap via
`bin/peakrdl_generate.py`); addr_mapper rewritten (single stacked extraction +
hash, 3 generate blocks + mux gone); bank_lsb/hash_en/hash_seed threaded through
pumice_axi4_ifc / wr+rd intakes / pumice_core / pumice_top (driven from
`hwif_out.ADDR_MAP`); program_defaults + test_pumice_top_csr + core tests
updated. FUB conformance (`test_addr_mapper`) rewritten to sweep bank_lsb across
[0, COL_WIDTH] + hash on/off vs a Python reference — 5/5. Full suite: 407 pass,
0 fail (macro 141 + fub/top 266).

`addr_map_scheme_e` retained only for the retired OLD macro sentinels
(pumice_core_macro / axi_frontend_macro / pumice_config_block), which were
carried to the new intake interface — candidates for future retirement.
